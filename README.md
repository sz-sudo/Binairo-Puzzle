# Binario-Puzzle
Binairo is played on a rectangular grid. Some cells start out filled with black or white circles (0 for white and 1 for black in input file). The rest of the cells are empty. The goal is to place circles in all cells in such a way that:

1. Each row and each column must contain an equal number of white and black circles. 
2. More than two circles of the same color can't be adjacent. 
3. Each row and column is unique.
